                    I was born in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia; which is where I've spent the majority of my life. I'm now in my third 
                    year of my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Computer Science, I spent my first two years in dorms, but this semestor 
                    me, my partner Kit, and our cat Candy moved into an apartment in Dartmouth! We've been really enjoying it 
                    down here, and it's been nice to meet our neighbors as well!
                </p>

                    My hobbies include playing games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Minecraft, Terraria (all of them being the 
                    modded variety with friends) and, of course, Kirby. I also make data packs for Minecraft such as my most recent one 
                    which gives the player the powers of Kirby. Me and partner like to play Overwatch as well, which they 
                    usually stream on their Twitch! Other hobbies include watching bad horror movies with friends, making 3D models, and curling up with a good book 
                    when I happen upon one.

                    Once I'm done my degree I'd like to take a Master's in Computer and Electrical Engineering, which should hopefully 
                    allow me to become a Computer Hardware Engineer, which is my current career goal. I've always loved building and 
                    working on computers, and so getting to make and design the components myself would be a dream come true.
                </p>

                    With all that said, that's really it!</p>
